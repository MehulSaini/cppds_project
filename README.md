# cppds_project
mini project for cppds:

This C++ program is designed to sort a linked list of strings in alphabetical order and identify and report any repeated words within the list. Users can input a set of words, and the program organizes them in alphabetical order, displaying the sorted list. It also detects and reports any words that occur more than once in the input, labeling them as repeated words. The program achieves this by utilizing a linked list data structure to store the words, sort them, and analyze the occurrence of duplicates. This program is a helpful tool for managing and analyzing lists of words, such as a simple vocabulary or word list, while providing insights into duplicated entries.
